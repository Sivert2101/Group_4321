            On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
            demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so
            blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame
            belongs to those who fail in their duty through
            weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are
            perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free
            hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like
            best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and
            every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of
            business it will frequently occur that pleasures
            have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this
            principle of selection: he rejects pleasures
            to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
